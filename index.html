            <p>I care about making complex systems feel simple, and building trust with the people who rely on them.</p>
            <p>If you'd like to connect, reach out at yanivnord@gmail.com or +1 (917) 523-8246. My resume and references are on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanivnord/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Teladoc</h3>
                    <p>I ran the UX team responsible for SAAS platform design in the Hospitals and Health Systems business unit at Teladoc.</p>
                    <p>One of our most challenging (and rewarding) projects was developing a solution to the problem of patient falls in hospitals. Each year between 700,000 and 1 million patients fall in U.S. hospitals â€” and the human and financial costs are staggering. We developed a solution that uses video and AI to detect falls and alert staff to intervene.</p>

                    <h3>Everplans</h3>
                    <p>I was the first design hire at Everplans, an innovative startup creating a secure platform for families to organize, store, and share life's most important information.</p>
                    <p>I learned so much during my years here about getting products from zero-to-one, and iterating from feedback in a fast-paced startup environment.</p>
