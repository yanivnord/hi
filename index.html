            <p>I'm <strong>Yaniv Nord</strong>, a design leader with a background in <strong>SAAS platform design</strong> across a range of industries, most recently <strong>healthcare</strong>, where I managed a team working on <strong>enterprise</strong> telemedicine applications at Teladoc.</p>
            <p>I've led design teams at startups and scaled organizations, worked across product, research, and strategy, and always try to keep one foot in the details and one in the big picture.</p>
            <p>I care about making complex systems feel simple, and building trust with the people who rely on them.</p>

                    <h3>Teladoc</h3>
                    <p>Most recently, I ran the UX team responsible for SAAS platform design in the Hospitals and Health Systems business unit at Teladoc.</p>
                    <p>One of our most challenging (and rewarding) projects was developing a solution to the problem of patient falls in hospitals. Each year between 700,000 and 1 million patients fall in U.S. hospitals â€” and the human and financial costs are staggering. We developed a solution that uses video and AI to detect falls and alert staff to intervene.</p>

                    <p>I learned so much during my years here about getting products from zero-to-one, and iterating from feedback in a fast-paced startup environment.</p>
