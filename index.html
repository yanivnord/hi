            <p>Hello, and thanks for visiting my website ðŸ‘‹.</p>
            <p>I'm Yaniv &mdash; a <strong>design leader</strong> with a background in <strong>SAAS platforms</strong> across a range of industries, most recently <strong>health-tech</strong>, where I managed a UX team working on enterprise virtual care applications at Teladoc.</p>
            <p>I've led design teams at startups, scaled organizations, nonprofits, and award-winning agencies, working across product, research, and strategy. I always try to keep one foot in the details and one in the big picture.</p>
            <p>I care about making complex systems feel simple, and building trust with the people who rely on them.</p>

                    <h3>Teladoc</h3>
                    <p>Most recently, I ran the UX team responsible for SAAS platform design in the Hospitals and Health Systems business unit at Teladoc.</p>
                    <p>One of our most challenging (and rewarding) projects was developing a solution to the problem of patient falls in hospitals. Each year between 700,000 and 1 million patients fall in U.S. hospitals â€” and the human and financial costs are staggering. We developed a solution that uses video and AI to detect falls and alert staff to intervene.</p>

                    <p>I was the first design hire at Everplans, an innovative startup creating a secure platform for families to organize, store, and share life's most important information.</p>
                    <p>I learned so much during my years here about getting products from zero-to-one, and iterating from feedback in a fast-paced startup environment.</p>

                <p>My career has been shaped by working on problems that really matter to people.</p>
                <p>I graduated Rhode Island School of Design in 1999 with some basic knowledge of HTML and some mean chops with Photoshop 2.0. It was the first dot-com boom and with those skills I was quickly able to land my first gig: the first-hire designer at a startup called Centerseat which had a grungy office around Union Square. I designed interfaces for live video streaming as well as companion static content. This was before YouTube or Vimeo or any of the other video streaming services that exist today. It was exciting to work on challenging problems that would later become mainstream, and I loved the idea of bringing things like the New York Philharmonic's performances to viewers around the world. The idea of front-end web developers didn't exist yet, and I wrote all my own HTML... in tables because CSS wasn't widely adopted yet. I didn't know it at the time, but this crash course in video technology would come in handy later in my career.</p>
                <p>I spent time at Citizens Union managing gothamgazette.com during the post-9/11 rebuilding efforts. As a New Yorker, it was a great opportunity to contribute during a really tough period of time in the city. I tought myself PHP and MySQL and built a custom CMS to manage our articles. I woke at 5am every day to publish our daily news roundup. With the editors, I built award-winning interactive games in Flash that helped people understand how the city ran, as well as contributing original reporting alongside the day-to-day design work. It showed me how much I love working with a team to create something that really matters.</p>
                <p>The education technology years at Schoolnet and then Pearson were formative â€” there's something humbling about designing software that millions of students, teachers, and families depend on every day. At Schoolnet in 2004, I got my first taste of user research when I took the Amtrak to Philadelphia and spent two days interviewing teachers and administrators at a few schools around the city. I learned that Information Architecture is a thing, and that wireframing in Visio is a thing. At Pearson especially, I learned how to scale design operations across 9 SCRUM teams while keeping everything coherent.</p>
                <p>My agency stint at Razorfish was my first real taste of the design world, working with major brands like Ford and Polo Ralph Lauren. The variety was incredible, and I loved the challenge of translating big brand strategies into actual user experiences. I learned a lot about how to work with clients and how to manage a team of designers. I also learned a lot about how to work with developers and how to get things done.
                </p>
                <p>At Huge, I got to work with Fortune 500 clients on everything from mobile trading platforms to fine dining apps. What I'll remember most is finally making the shift from waterfall to agileâ€”transforming not just processes but how teams actually think about iteration and feedback.</p>

            <p class="small">I coded this site in Cursor, which is a really cool tool until it starts randomly insterting jobs I never had into my resume. I got writing and editing help from Claude, and image manipulation help from Adobe's new AI tools. Type is set in Bernino Sans from Just Another Foundry. The case studies are built with Pitch. I like to design in <s>Microsoft Powerpoint</s> Figma.
